	A noble house hailing from the lush water world of Caladan. Uprooted from their home by the Duke Leto to take up a 
	fief on the harsh world of Arrakis. Seeking to outmaneuver their ancient enemies the Harkonnens, the Atreides set about 
	establishing a base of support and civil society on Arrakis from the capital city of Arrakeen, choosing to forgo the 
	Harkonnen’s previous capital and stronghold Carthag. Under the leadership of Leto the 1st they play a dangerous game 
	of cat and mouse, walking openly into a possible trap for the chance at controlling the universe’s supply of mélange: 
	the geriatric spice, a psycho stimulating drug with incredible properties. The spice cannot be synthesized or replicated; 
	it can only be harvested where it is naturally occurring on the planet Arrakis. Those that control the spice would have 
	immense leverage and power, as it is said: “The spice must flow”.

		Son of Duke Leto the First and the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica. As next in line for Duke, the legacy of the Atreides house 
		weighs heavily on Paul’s shoulders. From a young age Paul has been trained to be a mentat, a human computer with unparalleled 
		reasoning abilities. Furthermore he is pushed by the Bene Gesserit to become a male equivalent of a reverend mother, 
		the Kwisatz Haderach, or “one who can be many places at once”. Using the spice and his training Paul is able to become prescient, 
		to see into the future. As the events of Dune unfold and Paul becomes Muah’Dib (the Fremen word for desert mouse) this power 
		proves invaluable, but Paul also finds it a curse. The more you can see your own future, the more you are fated to it with 
		no recourse.

	A cruel and powerful house from the planet Geidi Prime. House Harkonnen are actually relatives of House Atreides, but a vendetta has the houses in constant conflict. The vendetta called Kanly, a special feud that complies with the conventions of the Landsraad bring the Harkonnens and Atreides into constant confrontation. The Harkonnens are honor-less however and break convention scheming with the Padishah Emperor Shaddam the Fourth to wipe out house Atreides. The Harkonnens rule through fear and an iron fist and no crime or evil is too great in the search for power.

Cunning and sadistic, the Baron is an excellent strategist and political actor. He is also morbidly obese. He wears suspensor robes to hold up his immense amount of fat. He is known to enjoy the sexual company of young boys and overindulges himself with food regularly. For all his faults the Baron is undeniably intelligent and dangerous. He stays two steps ahead of his enemies and is adapt at manipulation. He uses every tool at his disposal to further the interests and power of House Harkonnen and prepare the way for his chosen successor, Feyd-Rautha, to ascend on Arrakes as well as the imperial throne.

	The Imperial House Corrino rules the Imperium from the planet Kaitain, but the true power of the Padishah Emperor comes from his core of Sardaukar fighers. Killers without match, hand picked and groomed on the hell world of Salusa Secundus, the Imperium’s Prison Planet. The house also maintains its place on the Landsraad council as well as the Imperial Golden Lion Throne. House Corrino first came to power during their victory in the battle of Corrin and have been gripping it ever since.

		   Shaddam Corrino the Fourth is the 81st Padishah Emperor, or emperor of the known universe. His rule is in balance with the great houses of the landsraad making the Yin to the emporors Yang. The Golden Lion Throne draws most of its leverage and power from its Imperial core of Sardaukar, brutally efficient killers who come from the Emperor’s penal colony hell world of Salusa Secundus. Some even go so far as to compare Salusa Secundus to Arrakis and the implications abound. He is the father of Princess Irulan and cousin to the Duke Leto Atreidies. However, family ties only mean so much; Shaddam helps the Harkonnen in their schemes against the Atreidies, a flagrant abuse of convention as laid down by the great houses of the Landsraad. Sardaukar forces disguised as Harkonnens help with the invasion of Arrakis.

		The Fremen are the desert natives of the planet Arrakis. Seen by most outsiders as strange and uncivilized they are mostly ignored by any who hold a Fief on the planet. There is more to the Fremen though than is betrayed by their seeming lack of interest in city life. One of the most interesting traits of the Fremen is their blue within blue eyes. Completely blue all the way through, caused by ingesting large quantities of Melange. The Fremen are a secretive people with immense finesse when fighting in the desert. They are in fact far more powerful than most Great Houses give them credit for, as they pay the mysterious spacing guild enormous wealth in the form of spice in order to keep weather and observation satellites away from great swaths of the planet. Just what are the Fremen doing out there in the desert that they do not want known? Paul and Jessica are destined to find out. “Polish comes from the cities, wisdom from the desert.” -Fremen Proverb

	A mystical and secretive order of women. The Bene Gesserit permeate all the political on-goings in the universe. Through their special training Bene Gesserit possess incredible powers of manipulation, self-control and foresight. Sometimes called witches, or those of the weirding way by the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit influence cannot be understated. They act as advisors for rulers, while the order at large works to shape the fate of the Imperium in subtle and far reaching ways. Above all else the Bene Gesserit are patient, capable of planning many generations in advance to achieve their goals.
